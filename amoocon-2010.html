<p>I gave a 25-minute “Introducing CouchDB” talk at 
<a href="http://amoocon.de/">http://amoocon.de/</a>, Rostock, June 5th, 2010.
This is how it roughly went.

<p>See my <a href="#present">Slides</a>. Video is pending.

<h2>Jan Lehnardt, <a href="http://twitter.com/janl">@janl</a>, jan@apache.org</h2>

<p>Hello, my name is Jan Lehnardt. I’m open source developer. I’m coming from the
web and I have no experience with any VoIP stuff. Thanks to Stefan for inviting
me here.


<h2>CouchDB</h2>

<p>I’m working on a project called <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">Apache
CouchDB</a> and I’m here to tell you all about it — at least as a high-level
overview.

<p>In case you wonder, the name Apache just means that we’re in the same parent
organisation as <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache httpd</a> which I’m
sure all of you know.


<h2>NoSQL</h2>

<p>CouchDB is part of a new breed of database systems that all go under the term
“NoSQL”. I could try and explain what NoSQL means or stands for but that would
take about forever and instead I give you my subjective interpretation.

<p>NoSQL is about choice. All members of the group (there are 5–20+ depending who
counts) have a core idea they were developed around. Some are converging some
many are diverging. It’s the core ideas that are interesting; instead of listing
them all (there are too many), I go one level up and look at the whole scene.

<p>By being tailored to solving specific problems very well, NoSQL databases give
users <em>choice</em> of better systems for specific tasks. And the choice bit
is what I think is most important here. Instead of the one-size-fits-oracle
mentality, you can build better systems by choosing a data store that suits your
needs better. — Note that with “specific” I don’t mean “niche”. Some of these
systems are useful for 80% or 100% of the things people do with databases. It’s
like with Word; sure it has all these features for pros, but my mom just wants
to write a letter…

<p>I’ll give you the rundown on what CouchDB is best for.


<h2>Scaling</h2>

<p>Before I go into the details though, I dwell on one aspect that a lot of NoSQL
systems are at least tangentially targeting: Scaling. Scaling is a broad term
but in databases it almost always means scaling up, growing databases, adding
hardware to add storage or throughput capacity, being able to store tera- and
petabytes of data and growing quickly.


<h3>Uppers</h3>

<p>Scaling up is a race to specialisation. There is no one way to scale a database
to your specific needs (again, that’s why there are so many new database systems
coming up). Yet many of these systems try to be a one-size-fits-all solution
— remember how we are trying to get away from that? :)

<p>Scaling up is fun though, just add a few machines, double capacity, your
database cluster grows magically, deals with machine failure automatically.
Amazing stuff, and hard, geeks love hard problems, I’m sure you do and I’m sure
given the chance, you’d be interested in learning about all the funky techniques
people are using.

<p>This all sounds great, the problem though is, very few people need this. Your
average website isn’t as big as Facebook or Twitter (who do a crazy amount of
computing). I’d wager that less than 1% of all websites need crazy scaling
solutions. That’s still a good number, but I’m interested in making more
people’s lives easier.

<p>That said, CouchDB is fully capable of being set-up in large clusters and afford
the crazy scale-out. For those who need it, it can be done, and people do. There
are currently three scale-out systems on top of CouchDB. All tailored to
specific needs (c.f. one-size-fits-all). One is in production at the BBC, multi-
data-centre and all. One at Meebo.com and one at Cloudant.com.


<h3>Downers</h3>

<p>The trick about CouchDB now is that it also scales down very well. You can run
it on a small server or vserver to power your website and it’ll work fine and
with little fuss.

<p>You can even run it on your (smart)phone? No problem, Google Android, Nokia /
SiemensMaemo/MeeGo, Palm / HP’s WebOS, all in. iPhone and iPad…not so much,
thanks Apple.

<p>Why is scaling down important?

<p>CouchDB has a unique feature. It has a peer-to-peer synchronisation mechanism
built-in. It comes with automatic conflict detection, is very robust and is
dead simple to use. Much like rsync or git, you can give CouchDB two databases,
local or remote, and CouchDB will figure out what to do to make them equal.


<h2>Centralised Past…</h2>

<p>When the web came out, Tim Berners-Lee never envision Facebook, large
centralised services with a lot of power. He thought everybody would publish his
or her stuff on a personal web-server where others could read or fetch it from.

<p>He never envision a centralised system like Facebook that enormous power and
control.

<h2>…Distributed Future</h2>

<p>Because we didn’t have the tech to make that appealing to the mass-market, these
centralised services started to appear and grow. And control is great, that’s
what gets VCs to put billions of money into the social networks of the world.

<p>Opera saw that too, a few years ago they launched Opera Unite, a web server in
your browser. A lot of people thought crazy-talk, but that’s what the web was
meant to be. I believe, with Jon talking here yesterday even more so, that Opera
was ahead of the times once again.

<p>Over the last year, Facebook started to mock users with non-transparent changes
to their privacy system. This spurred the Diaspora project which wants to build
a decentralised social network, giving users back the power over their data.
Through a grass-roots donation collection site, they collected over $250,000 in
just a few weeks.

<p>People are ready for this.


<h2>Couchin’ Tech Details</h2>

<p>I’ll give you a few more CouchDB features before putting the big picture
together for you, be patient :)


<h3>JSON Baby</h3>

<p>CouchDB stores everything in JSON, JSON is great! Who here knows JSON <em>raises
hand? </em>Most of everybody, good. JSON is the subset of all programming
languages’ data structures. Not the super-set, it doesn’t try to accommodate
everybody, but it looks at everything that is out there and distills it to a
concise format.

<p>One of the many advantages is that you can take a Java object, serialise it into
JSON and deseralise it into Python without any loss or impedance mismatch.

<p>CouchDB doesn’t expect the JSON to be in a specific schema, allowing much more
natural data storage as in you can “just store data” instead of getting a math
degree first to figure out SQL.


<h3>MappingReducing</h3>

<p>MapReduce is the technique that made Google rich and famous. On top of being
highly scalable, MapReduce, much like schema-less JSON is easier to understand
for non-database-geeks, is more flexible and works better at large scale.

<p>The downside is that for database-geeks it might take some time to get, but I
think it’s a valuable trade-off, as I’m more interested in building simpler
systems for non-techy people.


<h3>Real-Time Changes</h3>

<p>One small, yet neat feature is real-time changes. A client and subscribe to
changes inside CouchDB. CouchDB will hold open a socket and whenever a change
happens inside CouchDB, the client will get a notification in real-time. This
is great for building chat systems, real-time cluster notifications and a lot
of other nice things.


<h3>CouchApps</h3>

<p>The last thing I’ll tell you about before bringing it all together are
CouchApps. CouchApps use all the things I talked about and a few more: CouchDB
has a REST/HTML API. You can store HTML inside CouchDB and it gets a URL. When
you point a browser to that URL, the HTML gets rendered in the browser; just
like a web server. Easy. 

<p>Now, you can also store JavaScript inside CouchDB as well and reference that in
the HTML and now you can use AJAX to talk back to CouchDB! You can build fully
database-backed web applications without any middleware that is Java, Ruby,
Python or PHP). This is awesome!

<p>“A browser talking directly to the database? — You crazy?!” you might say. —
Well, I have a t-shirt that says “My Couch Runs on Port 80” <em>turns 
around.</em>

<!-- TODO: add pic -->

<p>It isn’t crazy — see Opera Unite.


<h2>Building <strike>Less Crap </strike>Leaner Systems</h2>

<p>CouchApps allow you to build smaller, leaner, faster systems. Apps that have
less code, fewer bugs, are easier to understad, operate and maintain. It’s
awesome.

<p>Now, I’m bringing it all together. The reason why all of the above is important
and the sole reason why CouchDB is awesome is…


<h2>Sync</h2>

<p>Database synchronisation is <em>the</em> killer feature in CouchDB. It is what
ties everything I talked about together.


<h2>Sync!</h2>

<p>CouchDB sync, or <em>replication</em> allows you to synchronise two databases,
local or remote. It has automatic conflict detection and that allows a fully
decentralised setup; any database can be a master. It is fully peer-to-peer
capable.

<p>Syncing data between two machines locally is a piece of cake. In fact, since
last year, the Ubuntu desktop is shipping with CouchDB for personal data sync.
They created plugins for Browsers, mail clients, notes and so on to store their
data, contacts, bookmarks into CouchDB and use it to sync with other machines.

<p>They also have cloud-endpoint called UbuntuOne that allows everybody to create
an offline back (2GB are free, you pay for more). This is an integrated
solution fully based on CouchDB. Users are in control of their data and where it
goes, if they choose to, they don’t have to share it with anyone. CouchDB runs
both the client computers and the server backend. Scaling up and down is crucial
to make it all work.

<p>Mozilla is supporting this model with their new messaging client Raindrop. All
the mobile vendors are interested in this as well, the reason is twofold:

<p>One is latency, or locality of data. If the full application and data is
on the client and acting independently, the mobile device is a full app platform
not just a mere cache for stuff that has been downloaded at some point.

<p>Interacting with a local device is always faster than talking to any other
computer on the network. Localhost is always the fastet node in your network.
By the laws of physics you can’t add a machine to a network to make it faster.
You always add latency and latency is bad.

<p>Latency means a user has to wait potentially forever for results of his or her
actions. Low latency ensures a speedy user interaction. If it takes five minutes
to send or receive an email doesn’t really matter because it is not an action
the user has to wait on. This works great in situations with slow or spotty
network connection, which by the way are not only mobile connections in third-
world countries (these are surprisingly good compared to western networks) but
local DSL lines are usually oversubscribed, in peak times, bandwidth is a
fraction of what has been advertised.

<p>Using the network on a mobile device has another implication, it drains your
battery. If you use your app locally, you save radio and thus battery power when
using an app, sync can be delayed to until it is worth powering up the radio or
when a wifi is available.

<p>We’ve been talking to handset manufacturers, they are pretty interested in what
CouchDB has to offer here.

<p>Add technical advantage to a simpler development environment appealing to more
than just technical people and the privacy advantages of decentralised systems,
CouchDB is a pretty hot piece of technology and I hope you agree.

<h2>Breathe</h2>

<p>White slide, take a breath, mostly I should do that. <em>breathes</em>.


<h2>The Book</h2>

<p>I just touched on technical details, of course there is a lot to learn. The 20
minute format (which I like) just lets me waste enough of your time to
(hopefully) get you interested. Luckily I wrote a book. It’s O’Reilly’s CouchDB:
The Definite Guide and it is <a href="http://books.couchdb.org/relax">available
online</a> under the Creative Commons license. Thanks O’Reilly for allowing us
to do that. So you can read it online for free but it wouldn’t hurt us if you
buy a copy, just so O’Reilly knows you appreciate the open sourcing.
